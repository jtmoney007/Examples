Welcome to the Kubernetes Examples project! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and experimenting with Kubernetes, one of the leading container orchestration platforms. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Kubernetes user, you'll find a wide range of examples and tutorials here to help you master various Kubernetes features.

## Features

### 1. **Storage**

Explore Kubernetes storage solutions, including:

- **Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** Understand how to provision and manage storage in Kubernetes, and how to dynamically allocate storage resources.

- **Storage Classes:** Learn how to define and use storage classes to offer different types of storage in your cluster.

- **StatefulSets:** Dive into stateful applications and discover how to ensure data consistency and reliability with StatefulSets.

### 2. **Services**

Discover Kubernetes services and networking:

- **Service Types:** Explore different service types, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and understand when to use each.

- **Ingress Controllers:** Learn how to set up Ingress resources to manage external access to your cluster and route traffic to the appropriate services.

- **Network Policies:** Enhance security by implementing network policies that control traffic between pods.

### 3. **Security**

Prioritize security in your Kubernetes cluster:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define fine-grained access controls and permissions for users and services in your cluster.

- **Pod Security Policies:** Implement security policies to safeguard your pods against vulnerabilities.

- **Secrets and ConfigMaps:** Manage sensitive information and configuration data securely using Kubernetes secrets and ConfigMaps.
