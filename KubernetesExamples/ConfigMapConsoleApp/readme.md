# ConfigMap Reader for Kubernetes

This C# console application demonstrates how to read data from a Kubernetes ConfigMap in a specified namespace. It uses the official Kubernetes C# client library to interact with the Kubernetes API.

## Working with Kubernetes ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps in Kubernetes are a resource type designed to store and manage configuration data, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, configuration files, or any key-value pairs, separately from your application code. They provide a convenient way to decouple configuration data from application containers, making it easier to manage, update, and share configuration settings across different pods and containers within a Kubernetes cluster.

Here's a more detailed description of what ConfigMaps are and their key attributes:

1. Key-Value Storage: ConfigMaps primarily consist of key-value pairs, where each key represents a configuration parameter, and the corresponding value holds the configuration data. You can have multiple key-value pairs within a single ConfigMap.

2. Configuration Data: Configuration data can be anything your application needs to run, such as database connection strings, API endpoints, feature flags, or even entire configuration files in formats like JSON, YAML, or properties files.

3. Decoupling Configuration: ConfigMaps help separate configuration concerns from your application code. This separation allows you to manage and update configurations without modifying or redeploying your application containers, promoting a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

4. Flexibility: You can use ConfigMaps to configure various parts of your application, including environment variables, configuration files, and command-line arguments. Kubernetes offers different ways to consume ConfigMap data, such as injecting them as environment variables or mounting them as volumes in pods.

5. Dynamic Updates: ConfigMaps can be updated dynamically. When you modify a ConfigMap, the changes are automatically reflected in all pods and containers that use that ConfigMap. This dynamic nature simplifies configuration updates and helps maintain consistency across your application.

6. Immutable Data: ConfigMap data is considered immutable once created. If you need to change a configuration value, it's best to create a new ConfigMap or update the existing one and then roll out the changes to your pods.

7. Security: While ConfigMaps are suitable for non-sensitive configuration data, it's essential to avoid storing sensitive information like passwords or secret keys in ConfigMaps. For sensitive data, Kubernetes provides a separate resource called Secrets, which offers encryption and additional security features.

8. Versioning and Auditing: Kubernetes keeps a version history of ConfigMaps, allowing you to track changes and rollback to previous configurations if needed. Audit logs provide visibility into ConfigMap-related activities.



### Reading Data from a ConfigMap
This application can read data from a ConfigMap specified by its name and namespace. Set the JOB_NAMESPACE and JOB_CONFIGMAP environment variables when you create your Kubernetes Job YAML.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET SDK installed on your local machine.
- A running Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts, including ConfigMaps.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Build the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
   
3. Set the environment variables for your application by specifying the job's namespace, name, and the target ConfigMap. You can do this in your Kubernetes YAML files when you create the Job.
